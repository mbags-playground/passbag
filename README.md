# passbags

A cross-platform password strengthening tool

## Purpose

Transforms weak passwords into stronger ones by combining two weak passwords into a single, more secure password using a one-way algorithm.

## Motivation

Browser password managers often generate random passwords that are hard to reproduce. Passbags solves this by:

- Taking two easy-to-remember passwords as input
- Combining them using a consistent algorithm
- Producing the same strong password every time

This allows users to:

1. Generate strong passwords
2. Recreate the same password when needed
3. Keep using simple passwords as seeds

## How It Works

Just input two weak passwords, and passbags will combine them into one stronger password that you can reliably regenerate anytime.
